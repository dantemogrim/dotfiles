## ðŸ“– Instructions

_Requirements:_
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

- Clone this repository to your `$HOME`/`~` directory.
- Install all applications by running the following commands from your CLI:

```shell
# Ensure you have sufficient permissions to run scripts from the repo
# (if this doesn't work, add `sudo` to the start of the command).
$ chmod -R u+rwx ~/dotfiles
# Install all the things.
$ brew bundle install --file=~/dotfiles/Brewfile
```

- **Done!** ðŸŽ‰ There are plenty of configurations available from this repo that you can copy and paste over to your local home directory. I've deliberately _not_ made a symlinking script since my tools & config choices vary depending on whichever computer I'm working on. I do however store most of my faves here for safekeeping.
